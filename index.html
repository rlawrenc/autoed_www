<h1>AutoEd UML Database Design Demo</h1>

<p>AutoEd allows students to build database design diagrams in UML from text descriptions. Students learn how to identify key features in the description and model them in a database design as entities, attributes, and relationships. The system performs automatic marking of the diagrams and provide instant feedback. It is especially useful for students to practice questions. The system may be deployed as a stand-alone server and is integrated with the PrairieLearn system. Instructors can request access to the answers and source code. Students can practice any of the questions below.</p>
